OpenCL Multigrid solver for the 2D/3D Poisson Problem

Multigrid solver for the 2D/3D Poisson problem with the standard finite difference discretization. 
Both Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions are available for generic boundaries.

The target function and boundaries are hard-coded, see programstate.cpp.
Once you run multigrid2D or multigrid3D, type help to see the list of available commands.

This project is an experimental work for my Bachelor thesis, it has not been written to be re-used.

No license is provided, feel free to do whatever you want with this code.
